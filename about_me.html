        <p>Hey There! My name is Michelle Bui. I am currently a Computer Science at SFU. When I'm not busy arguing with computers, I'm off drawing or obessing over Valorant. So if you can't find me, I'm definitely busy clutching a game or two..</p>
        <p>Enjoy your stay! Hopefully, you'll also like the doodles I left here!</p>
